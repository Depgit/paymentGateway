TECH STACK:<br>
<ul>
    <li>Nodejs Backend</li>
    <li> express js</li>
    <li> mongodb </li>

but if u still like to clone<br>

clone the repository 
<br> run ```npm install```<br>
create a ```key.js``` file
and add<br>
```
module.exports={
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY:"your stripe secret key",
    STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY:"your stripe public key",
    JWT_SECRET: "JWT secrete key e.g. whatever you want like 12343321"
}
```
